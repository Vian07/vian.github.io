                    Our Cliques has 11 people. This Cliques was made at our school in SMAK 6 Penabur. We made this cliques because we have a
                    alot in common. Even though we are devided into 4 different classes, we are still friend. In our cliques
                    there are those who come from SOCIAL classes and those who come from SCIENCE classes. Me and 9 of my
                    friend are from SOCIAL classes, and the other 2 of my friend are from SCIENCE classes. We met each other
                    when we were in High School. We have alot of memory together. We makes jokes together, and when some
                    one of my friend tell some not funny jokes, we all quite and said that the jokes isn't funny. After we
                    told that, we laugh together because some of my friend always try to makes some jokes but always fail
                    make we laugh. The Humoris Cliques name is come from my idea because all of my friend always laugh everyday
                    and always make some jokes together or tell some funny story that happen in the school.

                <p>
                    We have gone on holiday together to Bandung. We did it when we were on semester break. We went to Bandung for 3 days and
                    2 night. We went there take the train, and at the time not all of our cliques member went to Bandung
                    because some of our friend already have vacation with their family. We have alot of fun together. When
                    we arrived, in the first day we only check in the hotel room and we take a rest at the hotel room. In
                    the second day we want to play airsoft so in that day we booked the airsoft place, after we arrived at
                    airsoft place, we got to listen some rules if we want to play airsoft because it can be dangerous if
                    we didn't listen the briefing. After we listen some rules, we start playing. After we play airsoft, on
                    that night we go again to play gokart. we spend alot of money in that place because we have so much fun.
                    in the third day, we are going to packing our stuff because at that night we must go back to Jakarta.
                    In the morning we are going to Trans Studio Bandung, we ha so much fun either in that place. We almost
                    play everything in that playground. In that place we take a long time because we need to wait our train
                    too. After we are finished play in Trans Studio Bandung, we go to Railway Station and wait our train
                    come. At the train we all take a rest and some of our friend go to sleep. After we arrived at Jakarta,
                    my mom pick me up and my friend to my house because in that time was midnight so my friend decided to
                    sleep in my house and go home tommorow morning.
